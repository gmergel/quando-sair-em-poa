quando-sair-em-poa
==================

"Quando sair em POA" (when to go out in Porto Alegre) is a visual application that uses car accident data to find the best days of the week (and shifts) to drive. Using data from EPTC (public transportation company), it maps the week days through 6 years and displays a bubble chart with information on the number of accidents, day/night and victims.

The application layout supports user control over the timespan and zooming in/out to get more details on a particular date.

Quando sair em POA was built using jQuery and CSS3 on the frontend, with PHP/SQLite on the backend.
